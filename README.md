# Project Euler in Elixir

My [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) solutions in Elixir. I'm new to both Elixir and mathematics, so don't take these solutions too serious!

## Goals

- Learn Elixir and functional programming in general
- Learn some mathematics

## Tests

All know solutions have a `doctest`. The tests can be run with `mix test`.

## Contributing

This repository is intended as a kata for myself, but I'm open to PR's and issues that provide feedback.
